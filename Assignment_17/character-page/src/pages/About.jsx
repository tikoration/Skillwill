                Fleabag is a thirty-three year old single woman and the main character of the eponymous series. She is played by Phoebe Waller-Bridge.
                <br/>
                Sarcastic, judgmental, and incredibly funnyâ€”although sometimes only to herself. Fleabag is a bit of an oddball and people are often confused by her dark sense of humor.
